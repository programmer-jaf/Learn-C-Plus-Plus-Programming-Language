## ðŸ“¦ What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a named storage location in memory used to hold data that can be modified during program execution.  
**Example in C++:**

```cpp
int age = 25; // 'age' is a variable storing an integer value
```

## ðŸ’¡ What is a Comment?

**Comments** are non-executable lines used to explain code, making it easier to understand. They are ignored by the compiler.

- `//` Single-line comment
- `/* */` Multi-line comment

**Example in C++:**

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
```

## ðŸŽ¨ What are Data Types?

**Data types** define the type of data a variable can hold (e.g., numbers, text). They determine:

- Memory allocation ðŸ“Š
- Operations allowed (e.g., arithmetic) âž•
- Values permitted (e.g., integers vs. decimals) ðŸ”¢
